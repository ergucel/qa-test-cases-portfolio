# Spotify Login – Test Case Portfolio

This folder contains manual test cases designed for a **Spotify-inspired mobile authentication flow**.

The focus is on validating core user journeys such as:
- App launch and welcome screen
- Navigation to login options
- Login with email and password
- Successful redirection to the dashboard

Test cases are written as **atomic, smoke-level scenarios**, based on real user behavior and publicly observable app flows.
