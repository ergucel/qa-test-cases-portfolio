# Spotify Login – Test Case Portfolio

This folder contains manual test cases designed for the **Spotify-inspired mobile authentication flow**.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate **test case design skills**, focusing on real user behavior, clear scope, and atomic scenarios rather than exhaustive coverage.

---

## Scope

The test cases in this folder cover the following user journeys:

- App launch and welcome screen validation  
- Navigation from welcome screen to login flow  
- Login options screen (email, Google, Apple)  
- Login with email and password  
- Successful redirection to the dashboard  

These scenarios are designed as **smoke-level and core flow tests**.

---

## Test Design Approach

While creating these test cases, the following principles were applied:

- Atomic and focused test cases  
- Clear preconditions and expected results  
- Realistic user behavior instead of edge-case-heavy coverage  
- No assumptions about backend or internal systems  

The goal was to validate **what the user sees and experiences**, not internal implementation details.

---

## Notes

- This is a **practice and portfolio project**.
- The application flow is **based on publicly observable behavior** of the Spotify mobile app.
- No proprietary, internal, or confidential information is used.
- The test cases are intended for **learning and demonstration purposes only**.
